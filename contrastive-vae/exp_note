good disentanglement:
    small temperature high beta

    measure should not involve inv(Sigma) in l2 norm on mu_diff

expr_one:
    set-up:
        1. seperate by 5 vs not 5:
            5 keep the same
            non-5 go through CMNIST dataset
        2. concat to form train data

        3. test data: 5 go through CMNIST

        check classification acc based on mu_c
    result:
        require style-overlap between 5s and non-5s
        (of course not complete overlap)
